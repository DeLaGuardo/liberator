# Handling POST, et al.

There's more than GET and HEAD requests. To be a useful web library
you better support POST, PUT and DELETE as well, and so does
liberator. While there are even more HTTP methods than those, liberator
has no out-of-the-box support for them and treat them like GET requests.
In any case you need to declare them as known and allowed.

## Enabling the methods

The allowed methods are determined by ````:method-allowed?````. The
default implementation for this decision uses the resource key
````:allowed-methods```` to obtain a list of methods and checks if it
matches the request method. When adding more methods to your resource,
make sure that the method is declared as known in
````:known-methods````. By default, liberator knows the methods from
RFC2616: GET, HEAD, PUT, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS, TRACE. Liberator 
implemented support for PATCH as of version 0.12.
See [RFC5789](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) for PATCH details.

## POST

Post requests share a lot of the decision flow with GET requests. The
main difference is that you can also reach the handlers
````:created````, ````:no-content```` and ````:see-other````. Because
post is a non-idempotent method, you can provide a function for the
key ````:post!```` which is optimal for changing the state on the
server. The negotiation of the status code is done afterwards. For the
details please refer to the decision graph.

An idiomatic way to support post is the following:

{% highlight clojure %}
  (def posts (ref []))
  ;;...
  (ANY "/postbox" []
       (resource
        :allowed-methods [:post :get]
        :available-media-types ["text/html"]
        :handle-ok (fn [ctx]
                     (format  (str "<html>Post text/plain to this resource.<br>\n"
                                   "There are %d posts at the moment.</html>")
                              (count @posts)))
        :post! (fn [ctx]
                 (dosync 
                  (let [body (slurp (get-in ctx [:request :body]))
                        id   (count (alter posts conj body))]
                    {::id id})))
        ;; actually http requires absolute urls for redirect but let's
        ;; keep things simple.
        :post-redirect? (fn [ctx] {:location (format "/postbox/%s" (::id ctx))})))
{% endhighlight %}

We can extend this example to support conditional request. Thus a
client can make sure that the POST is enacted only if no other request
was made since it checked the resource:

{% highlight clojure %}
    (ANY "/cond-postbox" []
       (resource
        :allowed-methods [:post :get]
        :available-media-types ["text/html"]
        :handle-ok (fn [ctx]
                     (format  (str "<html>Post text/plain to this resource.<br>\n"
                                   "There are %d posts at the moment.</html>")
                              (count @posts)))
        :post! (fn [ctx]
                 (dosync 
                  (let [body (slurp (get-in ctx [:request :body]))
                        id   (count (alter posts conj body))]
                    {::id id})))
        ;; actually http requires absolute urls for redirect but let's
        ;; keep things simple.
        :post-redirect? (fn [ctx] {:location (format "/postbox/%s" (::id ctx))})
        :etag (fn [_] (str (count @posts)))))
{% endhighlight %}

We also make a little resource to retrieve the posted content again:

{% highlight clojure %}
    (ANY "/postbox/:x" [x]
       (resource
        :allowed-methods [:get]
        :available-media-types ["text/html"]
        :exists? (fn [ctx] (if-let [d (get @posts (dec (Integer/parseInt x)))] {::data d}))
        :handle-ok ::data))
{% endhighlight %}

A quick test with curl shows that we cannot post to a stale resource:

{% highlight bash session %}
$ curl -i http://localhost:3000/cond-postbox
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 25 Apr 2013 15:52:45 GMT
Vary: Accept
ETag: "4"
Content-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 76
Server: Jetty(7.6.1.v20120215)

<html>Post text/plain to this resource.<br>
There are 4 posts at the moment.

$ curl -XPOST -d test -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' -H 'If-Match: "4"' -i http://localhost:3000/cond-postbox

{% endhighlight %}

# PUT request

The necessary steps to implement handling of PUT are mostly those for
POST. A key difference is that ````:can-put-to-missing?```` can lead
to ````:conflict?```` which can send you to ````:handle-conflict````.
This is not possible for POST requests. On the other hand PUT to a
nonexistent resource does not allow a response that sends you to a
different location. The necessary flow can be seen as always on the
[decision graph](decision-graph.html).

# PATCH request

The PATCH method is similar to PUT except that the entity contains a
list of differences between the original version of the resource
identified by the Request-URI and the desired content of the resource
after the PATCH action has been applied. The list of differences is
in a format defined by the media type of the entity (e.g.,
"application/diff") and MUST include sufficient information to allow
the server to recreate the changes necessary to convert the original
version of the resource to the desired version.

A rudimentary way to support patch follows:

{% highlight clojure %}
  (def content (ref ["Replace part or all of this string."]))
  ;;...
  (ANY "/patchbox" []
       (resource
        :allowed-methods [:patch :get]
        :available-media-types ["text/html"]
        :handle-ok (fn [ctx]
                     (format  (str "<html><body>\n"
                                   "The current content is:<br/>"
                                   (last @content)
                                   "Patch text/plain to this resource.<br/>"
                                   "Send a string in the format foo|bar.<br/>"
                                   "Any instance of the string to the left<br/>"
                                   "of the '|' will be replaced with the<br/>"
                                   "string to the right.<br/>"
                                   "There have been %d patches issued.<br/>"
                                   "</body></html>")
                              (dec (count @content))))
        :patch-content-types ["text/plain"]
        :patch! (fn [ctx]
                 (dosync 
                  (let [body (slurp (get-in ctx [:request :body]))
                        parts (clojure.string/split body #"\|")
                        replaced (clojure.string/replace
                                     (last @content)
                                     (re-pattern (first parts))
                                     (last parts))
                        id   (count (alter content conj replaced))]
                    {::id id})))))
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight bash session %}
$ curl --header 'Content-Type: text/plain' --request PATCH --data 'all|ALL' http://localhost:3000/patchbox
{% endhighlight %}

Values specified by :patch-content-types will be returned as part of the
Accept-Patch header in an OPTIONS request response for the resource.

In practice, one is more likely to implement the patch method using a more
formalized method of describing changes between documents. If one is managing
data in an XML format, perhaps XSLT can be used to describe the set of changes.

A more web friendly approach can be taken if the data is represented as JSON.
A simple library to handle JSON diff and patch can be found at
https://github.com/daviddpark/clj-json-patch, which was put together to meet a
need of handling patch requests with liberator.
